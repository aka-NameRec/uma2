Backend/Frontend Testing Log (2026-01-19)

Scope
- Backend startup ergonomics (uv run start, env loading), CORS handling, and API path fixes.
- JSQL execution fixes for parameter typing, cache behavior, and metadata consistency.
- SQL -> JSQL conversion diagnostics and performance logging.
- Linting/type-checking cleanup for touched modules.

Key changes in this branch
- Added backend start script and uvicorn entry point, fixed ASGI import path.
- Aligned .env loading with backend folder and documented CORS configuration; added CORS middleware.
- Hardened JSQL cached execution to preserve parameter binding safety and consistent typing on cache hit.
- Added parse/convert timing logs for SQL -> JSQL conversion and reduced log overhead on parse errors.
- Cached query metadata now persists across cache hits (meta is no longer empty on repeated requests).
- Updated FastAPI handlers and JSQL modules for ruff/mypy compliance.

Operational notes
- Existing cache entries without metadata require a cache clear or backend restart to see meta on cache hits.
- SQL -> JSQL rejects unsupported SQL constructs quickly; parse timing now makes slow inputs visible.

Tests and tooling
- pytest: 188 passed.
- ruff check: clean on modified files.
- mypy: clean on modified files.

Artifacts
- Commits in branch include fixes for cached metadata, SQL -> JSQL logging, and typing cleanup.
